# Dual-Mode Stopwatch  

## ðŸ“– Project Overview  
Develop a versatile stopwatch system using ATmega32 microcontroller, featuring increment and countdown modes with user interaction and alerts.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Provide a flexible stopwatch that counts up or down, displaying time in hours, minutes, and seconds.  
- Enable user interaction for resetting, pausing, resuming, and toggling modes.  
- Use visual and audio indicators for mode status and countdown completion.

## ðŸ’¡ Features  
- **Increment Mode:** Default mode counts up from zero with red LED indicator.  
- **Countdown Mode:** User sets countdown time, and stopwatch counts down with yellow LED indicator.  
- **Reset Function:** Resets time to zero in both modes.  
- **Pause & Resume:** Pause holds current time; resume continues from paused value.  
- **Mode Toggle:** Switches between increment and countdown modes.  
- **Buzzer Alert:** Activated when countdown reaches zero.

## ðŸ“š Hardware Components  
- **Microcontroller:** ATmega32  
- **Display:** Six seven-segment displays for hours, minutes, and seconds  
- **LED Indicators:** Red (increment), Yellow (countdown)  
- **Buzzer:** Sounds at countdown completion  
- **Push Buttons:** Adjust time and toggle modes
